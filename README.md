Data Description:
The TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) Trip Record Data refers to a dataset that
contains detailed information about taxi trips in New York City. This dataset is made
available by the TLC, which regulates and oversees the taxi and for-hire vehicle industry
in the city.
The TLC Trip Record Data includes various attributes for each taxi trip, such as the
pickup and drop-off locations, trip distance, trip duration, fare amount, payment type,
and additional surcharges. It also provides information about the taxi's unique identifier,
driver details, and other relevant trip-related information.
Analyzing the TLC Trip Record Data typically involves processing and cleaning the
dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, and applying various statistical and
machine learning techniques to derive meaningful insights. The large volume and
complexity of the dataset often require tools and frameworks like PySpark or Apache
Spark for efficient data processing and analysis.
